# Blood-Bank-Management-System
Blood is a body fluid in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells. Sometimes blood transfusion plays a crucial role in saving someone's life.

The project, Blood Bank Management System, is inclined to make the process of collection and distribution of blood, even the rarest types, easier so that no one has to lose their life due to blood loss or unavailability of blood.

The interface is user friendly and enables the user to either donate or request for blood. It also consists of an administrator interface and has the options of viewing and manipulating stocks, 
blood components, placed requests and donations. 

This project uses Python and database connectivity using SQLite3 and consists of a database called BloodBank which has 4 different tables for storing blood type stock, blood componenets stock, requests data and donations data.
